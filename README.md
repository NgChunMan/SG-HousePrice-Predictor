# Housing Price Prediction

This project predicts housing prices in Singapore using **Linear Regression**. Two methods are implemented for training the model:
1. **Normal Equation**: Directly calculates the best-fitting weights using a closed-form solution.
2. **Gradient Descent**: Iteratively updates weights to minimize the mean squared error.
